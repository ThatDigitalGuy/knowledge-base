# Setting up the Windows Server for the virtual network

In this section of the knowledge base I am going to be installing **Windows 2019 2022**. Using the **Network Plan** I am going to build the network with the computers requirements. 

## Setup

The hypervisor I am going to use is a type 2, and I am going to use a program called **Boxes** to manage the VMs in a simple interface. FIrst I am going to click the **"+"** button on the top left of the screen and click on the option **"Install from File"**.

Next I am going to navigate to where the VM images are stored and select the Windows Server 2019 iso file.

After that screen the configuration for the VM pop up and I will name the VM, **"SRV01-AD"**. After confirming all the settings I am going to click the **"Create"** button on the dialog window.

Once I click **"Create"**, Boxes will automatically create, start, and connect to the VM. When the **VM loads**, then I will go through the setup of Windows Server 2019. First, I will select my **language, time, and keyboard settings**.
