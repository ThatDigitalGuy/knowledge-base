# Adding Ubuntu Linux to Active Directory

In this section of my notes I will be showing how to join **Ubuntu 22.4** to an Active Directory Domain. There will be **2 methods** on how to achieve this on Ubuntu.



## Adding the domain on Setup

When setting up an Ubuntu Desktop machine, the setup has an option to allow you to join the machine to a Domain. You will find this option in the **"Who are you?"** section in the install wizard, as shown below.

Then after you check the option you should be presented with this section of the installer.
